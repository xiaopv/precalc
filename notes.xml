				<statement>
					Suppose that you work for a landscape designer Nancy. Her specialty is designing square ponds that are surrounded by hand-painted tiles. Customers can order the pond in any size square, starting with sides measuring <m>2</m> feet, and available in one-foot increments thereafter (sides of <m>3</m> feet, <m>4</m> feet, <m>5</m> feet, etc.). The tiles are <m>1</m>-foot square, and are placed edge-to-edge along the entire outer perimeter of the pond.
					<ol>
						<li>Draw a picture that describes a <m>2</m> by <m>2</m> square pond, clearly indicating the portion of the pond and the portion of the tiles. How many tiles are needed to cover the border for this <m>2</m> by <m>2</m> square pond?</li>
						<li>Repeat the last question for different pond sizes, from <m>3</m> by <m>3</m> up through <m>6</m> by <m>6</m>. Make a table showing the number of border tiles needed for each size.</li>
						<li>Based on the table that you created in the last part, if the side length of the pond is increased by <m>1</m> foot, how many more border tiles are needed? Explain why the number of tiles is increasing according to this pattern.</li>
						<li>How many border tiles are needed for a pond with sides of length <m>12</m> feet?</li>
						<li>If Nancy orders <m>64</m> border tiles for an upcoming job, how large is the pond the customer wants?</li>
						<li>Write an equation for the number of tiles as a function of the length of one edge of the pond.</li>
					</ol>
				</statement>
			</proposition>
			<p>The function that gives the number of tiles as a function of the length of one edge of the pond in the last problem is called a linear function. A <em>linear function</em> is of the form <me>y=mx+b</me> where <m>m</m> is called the slope and <m>b</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept of the function. If <m>(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2)</m> are two different points on a linear function with <m>x_1 \neq x_2</m>, then the slope of this linear function can be calculated using the formula <me>m = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</me></p>

							<li><title>RED Family</title> 1 adult. You are a Vietnamese American female who is a full time student working about 20 hours per week. You have a minimum wage job working in the library (no tips). But you got a scholarship, so you get $1000 at the beginning of every month.</li>
							<li><title>GREEN Family</title> 1 adult; 1 child. You are a young single white mom with one child working as a server at a nearby restaurant. Minimum wage is different if you receive tips - $8.35 per hour. You make minimum way, and you average about $350 per week in tips. You work 40 hours per week.</li>
							<li><title>BLUE Family</title> 2 adults; 2 children. You are a Latino family with two children under the age of 5. You canâ€™t afford to put both children in childcare. Mom stays home to take care of the children. Dad works 40 hours per week at a construction company that pays 2 times minimum wage for non-tipped employees.</li>
							<li><title>ORANGE Family</title> 1 adult. You are a young Black woman who is going to school part time and working full time (40 hours per week). You work at the same construction company as the dad of the BLUE family, but most Black women (including you) make 64% what men at the company make.</li>
							<li><title>PURPLE Family</title> 2 adults; 3 children. You are a family with three children. All three of your children are in school, so both parents works full time (40 hours per week). Both found jobs working for Amazon fullfillment center in Frankfort, NY. Amazon pays employees $17 per hour.</li>

				<statement>
					Suppose that you are in charge of managing constructing materials at a constructing site. You want to build walls to enclose a rectangular area to store the constructing materials needed for project and you want to have as much area as possible. However, you only have enough materials to build <m>180</m> feet of walls.

						<li>Pick your second favorite length and width and repeat the process of the last question. Which dimension gives larger area?</li>

						<li>Write a function equation describing the area of the rectangular area <m>A</m> in terms of the length <m>\ell</m>. Use Desmos to graph this function.</li>
						<li>Using the graph of this function, decide how should the wall be built to get the maximum possible area. What is the maximum possible area?</li>
					</ol>
				</statement>
			</proposition>
			
			<p>The function that gives the area of the rectangular region in terms of one side of the region is called a quadratic function. In general, a <em>quadratic function</em> is a function of the form <me>f(x) = ax^2+bx+c</me> where <m>a \neq 0</m>. We call this the <em>general form</em> of a quadratic function. Now try to rewrite the equation that you used in <xref ref="motivation-quadratic"/> in the form of <m>f(x)=ax^2+bx+c</m>. What are the values of <m>a, b</m> and <m>c</m>?</p>

			<p>If we want to find the function equation of a quadratic equation when given its graph, we have to pick three different points to plug into the formula <m>f(x)=ax^2+bx+c</m> because we have to figure out the values of three unknowns <m>a,b</m> and <m>c</m>. The computations will be lengthy because it involves solving a system of linear equations of three variables (it can be done pretty easily if you know how to use a computer package). We will not be doing this in this course. Instead, we will manipulate the function equation <m>f(x)=ax^2+bx+c</m> into a much desired form called the <em>vertex form</em> because a great deal of qualitative information about the function and its graph can simply be read off from this form. We will included the derivation of the algebraic manipulation in the following proof. Feel free to read the proof but it is not required.</p>
			<proof>
				<p>Before we start doing the algebra, let us recall that <me>(X+Y)^2=X^2+2XY+Y^2.</me> We will need this formula from <xref ref="quadratic-step1"/> to <xref ref="quadratic-step2"/>. Now we manipulate the quadratic function from the general form into the vertex form.
				<mdn>
					<mrow>f(x) \amp = ax^2+bx+c</mrow>
					<mrow>f(x) \amp = ax^2+bx+\frac{b^2}{4a} - \frac{b^2}{4a}+c</mrow>
					<mrow>f(x) \amp = a(x^2+\frac{b}{a}x+\frac{b^2}{4a^2}) - \frac{b^2}{4a}+c</mrow>
					<mrow xml:id="quadratic-step1">f(x) \amp = a(x^2+2\frac{b}{2a}x + (\frac{b}{2a})^2) - \frac{b^2}{4a}+c</mrow>
					<mrow xml:id="quadratic-step2">f(x) \amp = a(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2-\frac{b^2}{4a}+c</mrow>
					<mrow xml:id="quadratic-goodform"> f(x) \amp = a(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2-\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a}</mrow>
				</mdn>
				By renaming <m>h = -\frac{b}{2a}, k = -\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a},</m> we have <m>f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k</m></p>

				<p>Take Equation <xref ref="quadratic-goodform"/>, if we want to solve the quadratic equation <me> ax^2+bx+c = 0</me>, it is enough to solve the equation <me> a(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2-\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a} = 0</me> This is easy to solve because we have
				<mdn>
					<mrow>a(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2-\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a} \amp = 0</mrow>
					<mrow>a(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2 \amp = \frac{b^2-4ac}{4a}</mrow>
					<mrow>(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2 \amp = \frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}</mrow>
					<mrow>x+\frac{b}{2a} \amp = \pm \sqrt{\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}}</mrow>
					<mrow>x \amp = -\frac{b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}} </mrow>
					<mrow xml:id="quadratic-formula">x \amp = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</mrow>
				</mdn>
				Equation <xref ref="quadratic-formula"/> is the well-known quadratic formula that you have seen before.</p>
			</proof>
			<p>The <em>vertex form</em> of a quadratic equation is of the form <me>f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k</me>. The reason this is called the vertex form is because we can read off the vertex of the graph, which is <m>(h,k)</m>. The <em>vertex</em> of a quadratic function is the lowest point (if <m>a \gt 0</m>) or the highest point (if <m>a \lt 0</m>). Using the vertex form of a quadratic equation, we can find the function equation of a quadratic equation by first identifying the vertex (so we will know the values of <m>h</m> and <m>k</m>), and then pick a point on the graph of the quadratic equation other than the vertex to find the value of <m>a</m>.</p>

			<p>It is well-know that one of the way to measure angles is using degrees. One full rotation is <m>360^{\circ}</m>, half of a rotation is <m>180^{\circ}</m> and a right angle is <m>90^{\circ}</m>. We now introduce another unit to measure angles, called radian, that is based on the arc length cut by the angle, and the radius. Note that the circumference of the circle with radius <m>1</m> is equal to <m>2\pi</m> so we say that one full rotation is <m>2\pi</m> radian (or simply rad). Half of a rotation is <m>\pi</m> rad and a right is <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> rad.</p>

			<p>We now move to discuss inverse trigonometric functions. We started with the inverse sine function.</p>
			<definition>
				<statement>
					The inverse sine function <m>y=\arcsin(x)</m> if <m>\sin(y)=x</m> where <m>-1 \leq x \leq 1</m> and <m>-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq y \leq \frac{\pi}{2}</m>. The domain of <m>y=\arcsin(x)</m> is <m>[-1,1]</m>, and the range is <m>[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]</m>.
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>The domain of the sine function is all real numbers and the range of the sine function is <m>[-1,1]</m>. Notice that the domain of the inverse sine function is <m>[-1,1]</m> but the range is <m>[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]</m>, not all real numbers.</p>
			<proposition>
				<statement>
					Without using the calculator, evaluate each of the expressions: <m>\arcsin(-\frac{1}{2})</m>, <m>\arcsin(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})</m>, <m>\arcsin(-2)</m>.
				</statement>
			</proposition>
			<definition>
				<statement>
					The inverse cosine function <m>y=\arccos(x)</m> if <m>\cos(y)=x</m> where <m>-1 \leq x \leq 1</m> and <m>0 \leq y \leq \pi</m>. The domain of <m>y=\arccos(x)</m> is <m>[-1,1]</m>, and the range is <m>[0,\pi]</m>.

					The inverse tangent function <m>y=\arctan(x)</m> if <m>\tan(y)=x</m> where <m>-\infty \leq x \leq \infty</m> and <m>-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq y \leq \frac{\pi}{2}</m>. The domain of <m>y=\arctan(x)</m> is <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>, and the range is <m>[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]</m>.
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<proposition>
				<statement>
					Without using the calculator, evaluate each of the expressions: <m>\arccos(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})</m>, <m>\arctan(0)</m>, <m>\arctan(-1)</m>.
				</statement>
			</proposition>
			<p>Recall that for any function <m>f</m> that has an inverse function <m>f^{-1}</m>, we have <m>f(f^{-1}(x))=x</m> and <m>f^{-1}(f(x))=x</m>. One caveat is that these formulas are only true if <m>x</m> is the correct domain.</p>
			<proposition>
				<statement>
					If possible, find the exact value of each expression.
					<ol>
						<li><m>\tan(\arctan(-5))</m></li>
						<li><m>\arcsin(\sin(\frac{5\pi}{3}))</m></li>
						<li><m>\cos(\arccos(\pi))</m></li>
					</ol>
				</statement>
			</proposition>
			<p>Now we look at how to evaluate compositions of trigonometric functions and inverse trigonometric functions that are not of the same origins.</p>
			<proposition>
				<statement>
					Let us find the exact value of the expression <m>\tan(\arccos\frac{2}{3})</m>.
					<ol>
						<li>First, let us call <m>\arccos(\frac{2}{3})=\alpha</m>. Create a right triangle such that one of the non-right triangles is <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\cos(\alpha)=\frac{2}{3}</m>.</li>
						<li>Second, find out the value of <m>\tan(\alpha)</m>.</li>
						<li>Third, find out the value of <m>\tan(\arccos\frac{2}{3})</m>.</li>
					</ol>
				</statement>
			</proposition>
			<proposition>
				<statement>
					Find the exact value of <m>\cos(\arcsin(-\frac{3}{5}))</m>.
				</statement>
			</proposition>
			<p>Note that by the definition of the basic six trigonometric functions, we have <m>\cot(x) = \frac{1}{\tan(x)}</m>, <m>\sec(x) = \frac{1}{\cos(x)}</m>, and <m>\csc(x) = \frac{1}{\sin(x)}</m>. These relationships between trigonometric functions are called trigonometric identities. Here "identities" stands for "equalities". Note that a trigonometric identity involves trigonometric functions of an arbitrary angle and not a specific angle. As a counterexample, <m>\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}) = 1</m> is not a trigonometric identity because it is about one specific angle <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>. The big question is that are there any other identities. How do we find out?</p>
			<proposition>
				<statement>
					<ol> 
						<li>Look at <xref ref="problem-verifysimpletrigid"/>. Can you find some trigonometric identities? If so, write down the trigonometric identities.</li>
						<li>Now look at the trigonometric identities that you discovered in the last part, replace the trigonometric functions in the trigonometric identities with the definition of the trigonometric functions. (If you don't remember the definition, go back to the last unit to review them.) Then try to justify that the trigonometric identities are true. (This is called a proof!)</li>
					</ol>
				</statement>
			</proposition>
			<p>In order to prove a trigonometric identity, we can use other trigonometric identities that have been established. The more identities that we have established, the larger our toolbox will be. When trying to prove a trigonometric identity, start working with the side that is more than complicated than the other. This allows you to manipulate the expression using algebra to get the simpler form.</p>
