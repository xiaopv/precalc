</h3>Suppose that you are in charge of managing constructing materials at a constructing site. You want to build walls to enclose a rectangular area to store the constructing materials needed for project and you want to have as much area as possible. However, you only have enough materials to build <span class="process-math">\(180\)</span> feet of walls. <ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Pick your favorite length and width so that you can use all the building materials. Then calculate the area of the region.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Pick your second favorite length and width and repeat the process of the last question. Which dimension gives larger area?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Draw a diagram showing the rectangular area, and labeling the length of the region using a variable <span class="process-math">\(\ell\text{.}\)</span> Then find the width of the region in terms of the length<span class="process-math">\(\ell\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Write a function equation describing the area of the rectangular area <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> in terms of the length <span class="process-math">\(\ell\text{.}\)</span> Use Desmos to graph this function.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Using the graph of this function, decide how should the wall be built to get the maximum possible area. What is the maximum possible area?</div></li>
