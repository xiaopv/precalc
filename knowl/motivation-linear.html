</h3>Suppose that you work for a landscape designer Nancy. Her specialty is designing square ponds that are surrounded by hand-painted tiles. Customers can order the pond in any size square, starting with sides measuring <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> feet, and available in one-foot increments thereafter (sides of <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> feet, <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> feet, <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> feet, etc.). The tiles are <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>-foot square, and are placed edge-to-edge along the entire outer perimeter of the pond. <ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Draw a picture that describes a <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> square pond, clearly indicating the portion of the pond and the portion of the tiles. How many tiles are needed to cover the border for this <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> square pond?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Repeat the last question for different pond sizes, from <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> up through <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(6\text{.}\)</span> Make a table showing the number of border tiles needed for each size.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Based on the table that you created in the last part, if the side length of the pond is increased by <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> foot, how many more border tiles are needed? Explain why the number of tiles is increasing according to this pattern.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">How many border tiles are needed for a pond with sides of length <span class="process-math">\(12\)</span> feet?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If Nancy orders <span class="process-math">\(64\)</span> border tiles for an upcoming job, how large is the pond the customer wants?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Write an equation for the number of tiles as a function of the length of one edge of the pond.</div></li>
