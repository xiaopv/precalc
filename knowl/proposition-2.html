</h3>In this task, we will figure out the hourly wage necessary for a family in Utica-Rome area to afford housing. We will look at real data about hourly wages and the cost for renting each month. Your goal is to use mathematics to decide whether or not you think five families in Utica-Rome area are paid fair wages. The following table contains median market rent for different sizes of apartments in the Utica-Rome area in 2021. <figure class="table table-like"><figcaption><span class="type">Table</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">1.3<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>2021 Median Market Rent Summary</figcaption><div class="tabular-box natural-width"><table class="tabular">

</table></div></figure> The following are six different families living in the Utica-Rome area. In the Upstate New York region, the current minimum wage for non-tipped employees is $12.50 per hour and $8.35 per hours for tipped employees. <dl class="description-list">
<dt>RED Family</dt>
<dd> 1 adult. You are a Vietnamese American female who is a full time student working about 20 hours per week. You have a minimum wage job working in the library (no tips). But you got a scholarship, so you get $1000 at the beginning of every month.</dd>
<dt>GREEN Family</dt>
<dd> 1 adult; 1 child. You are a young single white mom with one child working as a server at a nearby restaurant. Minimum wage is different if you receive tips - $8.35 per hour. You make minimum way, and you average about $350 per week in tips. You work 40 hours per week.</dd>
<dt>BLUE Family</dt>
<dd> 2 adults; 2 children. You are a Latino family with two children under the age of 5. You can’t afford to put both children in childcare. Mom stays home to take care of the children. Dad works 40 hours per week at a construction company that pays 2 times minimum wage for non-tipped employees.</dd>
<dt>ORANGE Family</dt>
<dd> 1 adult. You are a young Black woman who is going to school part time and working full time (40 hours per week). You work at the same construction company as the dad of the BLUE family, but most Black women (including you) make 64% what men at the company make.</dd>
<dt>PURPLE Family</dt>
<dd> 2 adults; 3 children. You are a family with three children. All three of your children are in school, so both parents works full time (40 hours per week). Both found jobs working for Amazon fullfillment center in Frankfort, NY. Amazon pays employees $17 per hour.</dd>
</dl> For convienence of calculations, we assume that there are 4 week in one month. <ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Each member of the team will select one family to begin with. If your team has fewer than 5 members, come back to the remaining families after you have completed with your initial choice.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">For each family, create an equation that shows the family’s earnings over time. Carefully choose your input and output variable. Then graph the equation in Desmos. Use the color of each family for the graph.</div></li>
</ol> Once your team has created the equations and the graphs for all five families, answer the following questions. <ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Determine the type of apartment you think is the best for each family as a team. Who needs to work the fewest hours each month to pay rent? How did you determine this answer?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Who needs to work the most hours each month to pay rent? How did you determine your answer?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The purple line and the red line intersect at a point. What is the significance of this point?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Financial advisors recommend that you only use 30% of your montly income to pay for rent. Do the numbers of hours you found needed to pay rent match 30% of the earnings for each family? If not, what kind of hoursing can the family afford with only 30% of their income?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If we increase minimum wage to $15.00 per hour for non-tipped employees and $10.50 for tipped employees, how would that change the housing situation for each of the five families?</div></li>
