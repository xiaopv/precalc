<li id="li-35">Draw a picture that describes a \(2\) by \(2\) square pond, clearly indicating the portion of the pond and the portion of the tiles. How many tiles are needed to cover the border for this \(2\) by \(2\) square pond?</li>
<li id="li-36">Repeat the last question for different pond sizes, from \(3\) by \(3\) up through \(6\) by \(6\text{.}\) Make a table showing the number of border tiles needed for each size.</li>
<li id="li-37">Based on the table that you created in the last part, if the side length of the pond is increased by \(1\) foot, how many more border tiles are needed? Explain why the number of tiles is increasing according to this pattern.</li>
<li id="li-38">How many border tiles are needed for a pond with sides of length \(12\) feet?</li>
<li id="li-39">If Nancy orders \(64\) border tiles for an upcoming job, how large is the pond the customer wants?</li>
<li id="li-40">Write an equation for the number of tiles as a function of the length of one edge of the pond.</li>
