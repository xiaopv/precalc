<div class="para">If we want to find the function equation of a quadratic equation when given its graph, we have to pick three different points to plug into the formula <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=ax^2+bx+c\)</span> because we have to figure out the values of three unknowns <span class="process-math">\(a,b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span> The computations will be lengthy because it involves solving a system of linear equations of three variables (it can be done pretty easily if you know how to use a computer package). We will not be doing this in this course. Instead, we will manipulate the function equation <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=ax^2+bx+c\)</span> into a much desired form called the <em class="emphasis">vertex form</em> because a great deal of qualitative information about the function and its graph can simply be read off from this form. We will included the derivation of the algebraic manipulation in the following proof. Feel free to read the proof but it is not required.</div>
