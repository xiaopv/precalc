<div class="para">If we start with a single yeast cell under favorable growth conditions, then it will divide in one hour to form two identical "daughter cells". In turn, after another hour, each of these daughter cells will divide to produce two identical cells; we now have four identical "granddaughter cells" of the original parent cell. Under ideal conditions, this "doubling effect" will continue.</div> <ol class="decimal">
