You are a Vietnamese American female who is a full time student working about 20 hours per week. You have a minimum wage job working in the library (no tips). But you got a scholarship, so you get $1000 at the beginning of every month.  GREEN Family 1 adult; 1 child. You are a young single white mom with one child working as a server at a nearby restaurant. Minimum wage is different if you receive tips - $8.35 per hour. You make minimum way, and you average about $350 per week in tips. You work 40 hours per week.  BLUE Family 2 adults; 2 children. You are a Latino family with two children under the age of 5. You can’t afford to put both children in childcare. Mom stays home to take care of the children. Dad works 40 hours per week at a construction company that pays 2 times minimum wage for non-tipped employees.  ORANGE Family 1 adult. You are a young Black woman who is going to school part time and working full time (40 hours per week). You work at the same construction company as the dad of the BLUE family, but most Black women (including you) make 64% what men at the company make.  PURPLE Family 2 adults; 3 children. You are a family with three children. All three of your children are in school, so both parents works full time (40 hours per week). Both found jobs working for Amazon fullfillment center in Frankfort, NY. Amazon pays employees $17 per hour.  For convienence of calculations, we assume that there are 4 week in one month.  Each member of the team will select one family to begin with. If your team has fewer than 5 members, come back to the remaining families after you have completed with your initial choice.  For each family, create an equation that shows the family's earnings over time. Carefully choose your input and output variable. Then graph the equation in Desmos. Use the color of each family for the graph.  Once your team has created the equations and the graphs for all five families, answer the following questions.  Determine the type of apartment you think is the best for each family as a team. Who needs to work the fewest hours each month to pay rent? How did you determine this answer?  Who needs to work the most hours each month to pay rent? How did you determine your answer?  The purple line and the red line intersect at a point. What is the significance of this point?  Financial advisors recommend that you only use 30% of your montly income to pay for rent. Do the numbers of hours you found needed to pay rent match 30% of the earnings for each family? If not, what kind of hoursing can the family afford with only 30% of their income?

  "body": " Quadratic Functions and their modeling   Suppose that you are in charge of managing constructing materials at a constructing site. You want to build walls to enclose a rectangular area to store the constructing materials needed for project and you want to have as much area as possible. However, you only have enough materials to build feet of walls.  Pick your favorite length and width so that you can use all the building materials. Then calculate the area of the region.  Pick your second favorite length and width and repeat the process of the last question. Which dimension gives larger area?  Draw a diagram showing the rectangular area, and labeling the length of the region using a variable . Then find the width of the region in terms of the length .  Write a function equation describing the area of the rectangular area in terms of the length . Use Desmos to graph this function.  Using the graph of this function, decide how should the wall be built to get the maximum possible area. What is the maximum possible area?     The function that gives the area of the rectangular region in terms of one side of the region is called a quadratic function. In general, a quadratic function is a function of the form where . We call this the general form of a quadratic function. Now try to rewrite the equation that you used in in the form of . What are the values of and ?  If we want to find the function equation of a quadratic equation when given its graph, we have to pick three different points to plug into the formula because we have to figure out the values of three unknowns and . The computations will be lengthy because it involves solving a system of linear equations of three variables (it can be done pretty easily if you know how to use a computer package). We will not be doing this in this course. Instead, we will manipulate the function equation into a much desired form called the vertex form because a great deal of qualitative information about the function and its graph can simply be read off from this form. We will included the derivation of the algebraic manipulation in the following proof. Feel free to read the proof but it is not required.   Before we start doing the algebra, let us recall that We will need this formula from to . Now we manipulate the quadratic function from the general form into the vertex form. By renaming we have  Take Equation , if we want to solve the quadratic equation , it is enough to solve the equation This is easy to solve because we have Equation is the well-known quadratic formula that you have seen before.   The vertex form of a quadratic equation is of the form . The reason this is called the vertex form is because we can read off the vertex of the graph, which is . The vertex of a quadratic function is the lowest point (if ) or the highest point (if ). Using the vertex form of a quadratic equation, we can find the function equation of a quadratic equation by first identifying the vertex (so we will know the values of and ), and then pick a point on the graph of the quadratic equation other than the vertex to find the value of .

Is it possible that ? What about ? What are the possible outputs of the function ?      The domain of a function is the set of allowable inputs to the function. The range of a function is the set of all possible outputs from the function.    A function is said to be increasing if the graph of is going uphill from left to right. If the graph of is going downhill from left to right, then it is called decreasing .    Refer to the graph of in Figure .  Graph of     Find .  What are the coordinates of the vertex of ?

It is well-know that one of the way to measure angles is using degrees. One full rotation is , half of a rotation is and a right angle is . We now introduce another unit to measure angles, called radian, that is based on the arc length cut by the angle, and the radius. Note that the circumference of the circle with radius is equal to so we say that one full rotation is radian (or simply rad). Half of a rotation is rad and a right is rad.   Convert the angles to radians. Then develop a conversion formula between radian and degree.   An arc of a circle is a piece of a circle, and has length. A sector is a part of the plane enclosed by two radii and an arc of a circle, and has area.     What is the length of the arc along a circle of radius cut out by an angle of ?

From now on, we will be using radian to measure angles unless otherwise specified. We now discuss the six trigonometric functions of angles between and in the right triangles. After that we will discuss trigonometric functions for any angles.   A right triangle      Using the lengths of these three sides, you can form six ratios that define the six trigonometric functions of the angle . Note that and the definitions below do not work angles that are outside of this range.

The domain of is , and the range is .    Without using the calculator, evaluate each of the expressions: , , .   Recall that for any function that has an inverse function , we have and . One caveat is that these formulas are only true if is the correct domain.   If possible, find the exact value of each expression.        Now we look at how to evaluate compositions of trigonometric functions and inverse trigonometric functions that are not of the same origins.   Let us find the exact value of the expression .  First, let us call . Create a right triangle such that one of the non-right triangles is and .  Second, find out the value of .  Third, find out the value of .      Find the exact value of .   Note that by the definition of the basic six trigonometric functions, we have , , and . These relationships between trigonometric functions are called trigonometric identities. Here \"identities\" stands for \"equalities\". Note that a trigonometric identity involves trigonometric functions of an arbitrary angle and not a specific angle. As a counterexample, is not a trigonometric identity because it is about one specific angle . The big question is that are there any other identities. How do we find out?     Look at . Can you find some trigonometric identities? If so, write down the trigonometric identities.  Now look at the trigonometric identities that you discovered in the last part, replace the trigonometric functions in the trigonometric identities with the definition of the trigonometric functions. (If you don't remember the definition, go back to the last unit to review them.) Then try to justify that the trigonometric identities are true. (This is called a proof!)     In order to prove a trigonometric identity, we can use other trigonometric identities that have been established. The more identities that we have established, the larger our toolbox will be. When trying to prove a trigonometric identity, start working with the side that is more than complicated than the other. This allows you to manipulate the expression using algebra to get the simpler form.    Prove the identity .      Prove the identity .      Prove the identity .      Prove the identity .
